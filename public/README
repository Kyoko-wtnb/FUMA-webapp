# MAGMA outputs
######################
MAGMA gene analysis and gene-set analysis were performed with MAGMA v1.06.
From FUMA v1.3.4, MAGMA was updated to v1.07.
From FUMA v1.3.6a, MAGMA was updated to v1.08.
This does not change the principles of the analyses but file format and the extension of the outputs for
gene-set and gene-property were updated. Please refer to the MAGMA tutorial for details.
The MAGMA output from FUMA is based on summary statistics.
When genotype data is available, we recommend to re-run MAGMA locally with genotype data.
1. Gene analysis
  SNPs are mapped to the protein coding genes with user selected window size (with unique ensembl ID).
  All parameters were set as default (SNP-wise (mean) model for gene test).
  magma.genes.out: output of gene analysis containing gene P-value
  magma.genes.raw: output of gene analysis which is used for gene-set analysis
2. Gene-set analysis
  Gene sets were obtained from MsigDB v5.2. Total 10894 gene sets (Curated gene sets: 4728, GO terms:6166) were tested.
  From FUMA v1.3.1, gene sets were updated for MsigDB v6.1. Total 10655 gene sets (Curated gene sets: 4738, GO terms: 5917) were tested.
  From FUMA v1.3.4, gene sets were updated for MsigDB v6.2. Total 10678 gene sets (Curated gene sets: 4761, GO terms: 5917) were tested.
  From FUMA v1.3.5d, gene sets were updated for MsigDB v7.0. Total 15496 gene sets (Curated gene sets: 5500, GO terms: 9996) were tested.
  Curated gene sets consists of 9 data resources including KEGG, Reactome and BioCarta (http://software.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/collection_details.jsp#C2 for details).
  GO terms consists of three categories, biological processes (bp), cellular components (cc) and molecular functions (mf).
  All parameters were set as default (competitive test).
  magma.sets.out: output of gene-set analysis containing P-value per gene set
  magma.setgenes.out: output of gene-set analysis containing all genes in each significant gene sets. This file is only available when there is significant gene sets after Bonferroni correction.
3. Tissue expression analysis
  Gene expression data sets were obtained from one of the following, GTEx v6, v7, v8 and BrainSpan.
  MAGMA gene-property test was performed for average gene-expression per category (e.g. tissue type or developmental stage) conditioning on average expression across all categories (one-side).
  This tests positive relationship between gene expression in a specific category and genetic associations.
  magma_exp_xxx.gcov.out: output of user selected data sets.
Please refer to the manual of MAGMA from https://ctg.cncr.nl/software/magma for more details.
