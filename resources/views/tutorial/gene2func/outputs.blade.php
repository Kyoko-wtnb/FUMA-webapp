<h3 id="g2fOutputs">Outputs of GENE2FUNC</h3>
<div style="padding-left: 40px;">
	<h4><strong>1. Summary of input genes and download files</strong></h4>
	<p>
		1) <strong>Summary of input genes</strong><br/>
		The table summarised the input genes and background genes.
		Input genes which are not used in the GENE2FUNC analyses due to lack of matching gene ID
		are also listed.
		Since the primary gene ID of FUMA is Ensembl ID and not all Ensembl IDs are mapped to unique
		entrez ID (NCBI gene ID), the number of unique entrez ID can be smaller than the number of
		input genes with Ensembl ID.
		Ensembl ID is used for expression heatmap and tissue specificity analyses,
		and entrez ID is used for gene set enrichment analysis.
		<br/>
		2) <strong>Download files</strong><br/>
		Results of GENE2FUNC can be downloaded as text file from here.
		<br/>
		3) <strong>Parameters</strong><br/>
		The table contains input parameters. This can be also downloaded from the option above.

	<h4><strong>2. Gene Expression Heatmap</strong></h4>
	<p>
		The heatmap displays two expression values.<br/>
		1) <strong>Average expression per label</strong><br/>
		This is an averaged expression value per label (e.g. tissue types or developmental stage)
		per gene following to winsorization at 50 and log 2 transformation with pseudocount 1.
		The expression value depends on the data set, RPKM (Read Per Kilobase per Million)
		for GTEx v6 and BrainSapn, TPM (Transcripts Per Million) for GTEx v7/v8.
		For Allen Human Brain Atlas, normalized microarry gene expression value as obtained from the resource.
		This allows for comparison across labels and genes.
		Hence, cells filled in red represent higher expression compared to cells filled in blue across genes and labels.<br/>
		2) <strong>Average of normalized expression per label</strong><br/>
		This is the average of normalized expression (zero mean across samples)
		following to winsorization at 50 and log 2 transformation of the expression value with pseudocount 1.
		For Allen Human Brain Atlas, normalized microarray gene expression value was scaled per gene.
		This allows comparison of gene expression across labels (horizontal comparison) within a gene.
		Thus expression values of different genes within a label (vertical comparison) are not comparable.
		Hence, cells filled in red represents higher expression of the genes in
		a corresponding label compared to other labels, but it DOES NOT represent
		higher expression compared to other genes.
	</p>
	<p>
		Labels (columns) and genes (rows) can be ordered by alphabetically or cluster (hierarchical  clustering).
		Hierarchical  clustering is performed using python scipy package (using "average" method).<br/>
		The heatmap is downloadable in several file formats. Note that the image will be downloaded as displayed.

	<h4><strong>3. Tissue specificity</strong></h4>
	<p>
		Tissue specificity is tested using the differentially expressed genes
		defined for each label of each expression data set<br/>
		<br/>
		<strong>Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) Sets</strong><br/>
		DEG sets were pre-calculated by performing two-sided t-test for any one of labels against all others.
		For this, expression values were normalized (zero-mean) following to a log 2 transformation of expression value (EPKM or TPM).
		Genes which with P-value &le; 0.05 after Bonferroni correction and absolute log fold change &ge; 0.58 were
		defined as differentially expressed genes in a given label compared to others.
		On top of DEG, up-regulated DEG and down-regulated DEG were also pre-calculated by taking sign of t-statistics into account.
		<br/><br/>
	</p>
	<p>
		Input genes were tested against each of the DEG sets using the hypergeometric test.
		The background genes are genes that have average expression value > 1 in at
		least one of the labels and exist in the user selected background genes.
		Significant enrichment at Bonferroni corrected P-value &le; 0.05 are coloured in red.<br/>
		<span class="info"><i class="fa fa-info"></i>
		Note that for DEG sets, Bonferroni correction is performed for each of up-regulated, down-regulated and both-sided DEG sets separately.
		</span><br/><br/>
		Results and images are downloadable as text files and in several image file formats.
	</p>
	<p>
		<span class="info"><i class="fa fa-info"></i>
			Note that Allen Human Brain Atlas (AHBA) data is only available for level 2 and level 3 brain regions.
			This is because the differences of gene expression patterns across brain regions are subtle and
			the number of significant DEGs is not sufficient to perform this enrichment analysis for level 4 and level5.

	<h4><strong>4. Gene Sets</strong></h4>
	<p>
		Hypergeometric tests are performed to test if genes of interest are overrepresented in any of  the pre-defined gene sets.
		Multiple test correction is performed per category, (i.e. canonical pathways, GO biological processes and so on, separately).
		Gene sets were obtained from MsigDB, WikiPathways and reported genes from the GWAS-catalog.
	</p>
	<p>
		The full results are downloadable as a text file at the top of the page. <br/>
		In each category, plot view and table view are selectable.
		In the plot view, images are downloadable in several file formats.

	<br/><br/>

	<h4><strong>5. Gene Table</strong></h4>
	<p>
		Input genes are mapped to OMIM ID, UniProt ID, Drug ID of DrugBank and links to GeneCards.
		Drug IDs are assigned if the UniProt ID of the gene is one of the targets of the drug.<br/>
		Each link to OMIM, Drugbank and GeneCards will open in a new tab.
